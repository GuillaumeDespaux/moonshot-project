# Moonshot Project - Guillaume DESPAUX - Project Analysis

## Objectives
The objective of this project is to eliminate the need for human involvement in conducting roll calls. This is particularly relevant for organizations and educational institutions, where roll calls are often required multiple times a day and are traditionally managed by personnel.

Although similar devices already exist, none currently implement a form of two-factor authentication to prevent individuals from handing over their access cards to others for attendance purposes.

## Constraints
The project must adhere to the following constraints:
- Individuals may give their access cards to others.
- Facial recognition technology cannot be used.
- Fingerprint scanning is not allowed.
