# Weekly Report of Guillaume DESPAUX Moonshot
### Weekly Report - Week of October 14, 2024

1. **Introduction:**  
- This week is the real start of the moonshot project, before the kick off I already thought about the methods to create the double authentication:
    1. QR Code
        - Use the phone to scan one unique QR Code after presenting the user card, that redirect onto the Skills website.
    2. Pin code
        - Every student will have an unique code each project to login in after the card.
    3. Computer application
        - After the card presentation an notification will pop-up on the computer of the user to ensure that it is really him.
    4. Phone application
        - After the card presentation an notification will pop-up on his phone's user to ensure that it is really him.
