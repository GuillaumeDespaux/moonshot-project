## 1. Introduction

Some years ago when I where trainer with my parents, doing roll call was a simple and straightforward task. We had approximately 10 trainees per session, so there where no difficulty at all for this task. However when I stopped being a trainer, and became myself a trainee again, I understood that doing this task, depends on the size of the organization. For instance when I arrived in 2023 at ALGOSUP's school and saw Jean-Philipe losing around 20 to 30 minutes each morning and afternoon doing the roll call. This observation have been making me thinking: "Why don't we automate this task?".

## 2. Objectives

This is why today I present this project as moon shot. The main goal is to stop losing time doing this, and for companies who don't want lose energy. The main purpose is to create something easy to use, compatible with a lot of computers, and also make it the less expensive as possible.

## 3. Scope

The project will consist of two main products: a hardware component for user identification and an application for user verification. The goals for those products are to simplify the life of each companies that have daily registration with many people.

### 3.1. For Companies/Organizations

- **Ease to use**: Designed to be intuitive and straightforward, minimizing the need for training or specialized skills.
- **Quick access to results**: Provides fast and reliable attendance reports to streamline decision-making and operations.
- **Automation of roll call**: Eliminates the need for manual attendance-taking, saving time and reducing errors.
- **Time saving**: Frees up valuable time for employees to focus on higher priority tasks.

### 3.2. For Users

- **Ease to use**: Simple interface to ensure smooth user interaction without confusion.
- **Improved discipline**: Encourages punctuality and accountability through reliable tracking systems.
- **Enhanced productivity**: Allows users to focus on their work rather than attendance-related tasks, contributing to overall efficiency.
- **Compatibility**: The users will be able to use the software for any computers (Windows, macOs, Linux).

## 4. Out of Scope Features

### 4.1. For Companies/Organizations

- **Automatically assigning blame**: The system will not determine or assign fault to individuals, as this exceeds the intended purpose of simplifying roll calls and introduces ethical and technical challenges.
- **Integration with disciplinary systems**: Features for managing disciplinary actions, such as issuing warnings or escalating absences, are not included.

### 4.2. For Users

- **Predicting lateness**: The system will not forecast lateness using external factors (e.g., traffic or weather) due to the complexity and additional resources required for such functionality.
- **Preventing absences**: The systemâ€™s role is limited to recording attendance, not actively preventing absences or enforcing user behavior.
- **Productivity tools**: Features like reminders or personal notifications to improve time management.
- **Phones**: The system's compatibility will be only on computers discarding the phones option at least for the prototype.

### 4.3. General

- **Unrelated functionalities**: Any features not directly related to automating roll calls or tracking attendance will not be addressed in this project.

## 5. Functional Requirements

The functional requirements define the specific features and capabilities of the system, including hardware, software, and data interactions.

### 5.1 Hardware

- **Internet Connectivity**: The hardware must be connected to the Internet to communicate with the API[^2].
- **Local Data Storage**: The hardware should store data locally in case of Internet connectivity issues.
- **Data Transmission**: The hardware must send data online at least twice a day to ensure information readability.
- **User Identification Creation**: The system should allow the creation of new user identification cards.
- **User Identification Reading**: The system must read user identification cards to retrieve information.
- **User Identification Updating**: The system should provide an update mechanism for users who leave the organization.
- **User Identification Deletion**: The system must be able to delete user identification card information.

    end
```

</div>

### 5.2 API

- **Information Reception from Hardware**: The API[^2] must receive information from the hardware for analysis.
- **Information Sorting**: The API[^2] should efficiently sort all received information.
- **Information Transmission**: The API[^2] must send information to the application to confirm the second step of authentication.

<div align="center">

```mermaid

    subgraph API Interaction
    api[/API/]
    hardware{Hardware} --Card Information--> api
    end
```

</div>

### 5.3 Database

- **Store Information**: The database[^6] must securely store all user and attendance information, ensuring data integrity and availability.
- **Give Information**: The database[^6] should provide quick and reliable access to stored information for authorized users and systems.
- **Keep Information A Certain Amount Of Time**: The database[^6] must retain information for a specified duration, complying with organizational policies and legal requirements.

    subgraph Database Interaction
    db[(Database)]
    api[/API/] --ID Exist?--> db
    db --Yes/No --> apipro
    apipro{API}
    end
```

</div>

### 5.4 Software (2FA)

- **Role Differentiation**: Users will have different options based on their roles within the organization.
- **Background Operation**: The application should run in the background, displaying pop-ups based on user roles.
- **Unique User Identification**: The application must obtain the computer's MAC Address[^4] to ensure the person activating the hardware is the same person validating through the application.

<div align="center">

```mermaid

    subgraph Software Interaction
    app{Software}
    apipro{API} --Notification--> app

    end
```

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

The non-functional requirements define the quality attributes of the system, such as performance, security, and usability.

### 6.1 Performance

- **Battery Life**: The hardware should have a long-lasting battery to ensure continuous operation throughout the day without frequent recharging between 14 days and 31 days.
- **Duration**: The system must be capable of handling high volumes of data and user interactions without degradation in performance over extended periods to prevent users be needed to buy often new device.
- **Response Time**: The system should provide quick response times for all operations, including user identification, data transmission, and report generation in less than 2 seconds, to ensure a seamless user experience.

### 6.2 Security

- **GDP Compliance**: The system must comply with GDPR[^3] regulations to protect user data and ensure privacy.
- **Account Security**: User accounts should be protected with strong authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: The system should implement role-based access control to ensure that users can only access information and perform actions that are relevant to their roles.

### 6.3 Usability

- **Compatibility with Computers**: The system should be compatible with various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, to ensure broad usability.
- **Exclusion of Phones**: The system is designed to be used on computers only, and will not support mobile phone compatibility.
- **Authentication System**: The system should include a robust authentication system to verify user identities and ensure secure access to the application and data.
