## 1. Introduction
Some years ago when I where trainer with my parents, doing roll call was a simple and straightforward task. We had approximately 10 trainees per session, so there where no difficulty at all for this task. However when I stopped being a trainer, and became myself a trainee again, I understood that doing this task, depends on the size of the organization. For instance when I arrived in 2023 at ALGOSUP's school and saw Jean-Philipe losing around 20 to 30 minutes each morning and afternoon doing the roll call. This observation have been making me thinking: "Why don't we automate this task?".

## 2. Objectives
This is why today I present this project as moon shot. The main goal is to stop losing time doing this, and for companies who don't want lose energy. The main purpose is to create something easy to use, compatible with a lot of computers, and also make it the less expensive as possible.

## 3. Scope
<!-- Define the scope of the project, including what is in scope and what is out of scope. -->
The goals for those products are to simplify the life of each companies that have daily registration with many people.

### 3.1. For Companies/Organizations:
- **Ease to use**: Designed to be intuitive and straightforward, minimizing the need for training or specialized skills.
- **Quick access to results**: Provides fast and reliable attendance reports to streamline decision-making and operations.
- **Automation of roll call**: Eliminates the need for manual attendance-taking, saving time and reducing errors.
- **Time saving**: Frees up valuable time for employees to focus on higher priority tasks.

### 3.2. For Users:
- **Ease to use**: Simple interface to ensure smooth user interaction without confusion.
- **Improved discipline**: Encourages punctuality and accountability through reliable tracking systems.
- **Enhanced productivity**: Allows users to focus on their work rather than attendance-related tasks, contributing to overall efficiency.
- **Compatibility**: The users will be able to use the software for any computers (Windows, macOs, Linux).
## 4. Out of Scope Features

### 4.1. For Companies/Organizations:
- **Automatically assigning blame**: The system will not determine or assign fault to individuals, as this exceeds the intended purpose of simplifying roll calls and introduces ethical and technical challenges.
- **Integration with disciplinary systems**: Features for managing disciplinary actions, such as issuing warnings or escalating absences, are not included.

### 4.2. For Users
- **Predicting lateness**: The system will not forecast lateness using external factors (e.g., traffic or weather) due to the complexity and additional resources required for such functionality.
- **Preventing absences**: The systemâ€™s role is limited to recording attendance, not actively preventing absences or enforcing user behavior.
- **Productivity tools**: Features like reminders or personal notifications to improve time management are outside the scope.
- **Phones**: The system's compatibility will be only on computers discarding the phones option.

### 4.3. General:
- **Unrelated functionalities**: Any features not directly related to automating roll calls or tracking attendance will not be addressed in this project.
