## 1. Introduction
Some years ago when I where trainer with my parents, doing roll call was a simple and straightforward task. We had approximately 10 trainees per session, so there where no difficulty at all for this task. However when I stopped being a trainer, and became myself a trainee again, I understood that doing this task, depends on the size of the organization. For instance when I arrived in 2023 at ALGOSUP's school and saw Jean-Philipe losing around 20 to 30 minutes each morning and afternoon doing the roll call. This observation have been making me thinking: "Why don't we automate this task?".

## 2. Objectives
This is why today I present this project as moon shot. The main goal is to stop losing time doing this, and for companies who don't want lose energy. The main purpose is to create something easy to use, compatible with a lot of computers, and also make it the less expensive as possible.

## 3. Scope
<!-- Define the scope of the project, including what is in scope and what is out of scope. -->
The goals for those products are to simplify the life of each companies that have daily registration with many people.

### 3.1. For Companies/Organizations:
- **Ease to use**: Designed to be intuitive and straightforward, minimizing the need for training or specialized skills.
- **Quick access to results**: Provides fast and reliable attendance reports to streamline decision-making and operations.
- **Automation of roll call**: Eliminates the need for manual attendance-taking, saving time and reducing errors.
- **Time saving**: Frees up valuable time for employees to focus on higher priority tasks.

### 3.2. For Users:
- **Ease to use**: Simple interface to ensure smooth user interaction without confusion.
- **Improved discipline**: Encourages punctuality and accountability through reliable tracking systems.
- **Enhanced productivity**: Allows users to focus on their work rather than attendance-related tasks, contributing to overall efficiency.
- **Compatibility**: The users will be able to use the software for any computers (Windows, macOs, Linux).
## 4. Out of Scope Features

### 4.1. For Companies/Organizations:
- **Automatically assigning blame**: The system will not determine or assign fault to individuals, as this exceeds the intended purpose of simplifying roll calls and introduces ethical and technical challenges.
- **Integration with disciplinary systems**: Features for managing disciplinary actions, such as issuing warnings or escalating absences, are not included.

### 4.2. For Users
- **Predicting lateness**: The system will not forecast lateness using external factors (e.g., traffic or weather) due to the complexity and additional resources required for such functionality.
- **Preventing absences**: The systemâ€™s role is limited to recording attendance, not actively preventing absences or enforcing user behavior.
- **Productivity tools**: Features like reminders or personal notifications to improve time management are outside the scope.
- **Phones**: The system's compatibility will be only on computers discarding the phones option.

### 4.3. General:
- **Unrelated functionalities**: Any features not directly related to automating roll calls or tracking attendance will not be addressed in this project.


## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Hardware
- **Internet Connectivity**: The hardware must be connected to the Internet to communicate with the [API](#api).
- **Local Data Storage**: The hardware should store data locally in case of Internet connectivity issues.
- **Data Transmission**: The hardware must send data online at least twice a day to ensure information readability.
- **User Identification Creation**: The system should allow the creation of new user identification cards.
- **User Identification Reading**: The system must read user identification cards to retrieve information.
- **User Identification Updating**: The system should provide an update mechanism for users who leave the organization.
- **User Identification Deletion**: The system must be able to delete user identification card information.

    start((User))-- Use Card --> hardware[/Hardware/]
    end
```
### 5.2 API
- **Information Reception from Hardware**: The [API](#api) must receive information from the hardware for analysis.
- **Information Sorting**: The [API](#api) should efficiently sort all received information.
- **Information Transmission**: The [API](#api) must send information to the application to confirm the second step of authentication.

```mermaid
graph
    subgraph API Interaction
    api[/API/]
    hardware{Hardware} --Card Information--> api
    end
```
### 5.3 Database
- **Store Information**: The [database](#database) must securely store all user and attendance information, ensuring data integrity and availability.
- **Give Information**: The [database](#database) should provide quick and reliable access to stored information for authorized users and systems.
- **Keep Information A Certain Amount Of Time**: The [database](#database) must retain information for a specified duration, complying with organizational policies and legal requirements.

graph
    subgraph Database Interaction
    db[(Database)]
    api[/API/] --ID Exist?--> db
    db --Yes/No --> apipro
    apipro{API}
    end
```

### 5.4 Application ([2FA](#2fa))
- **Role Differentiation**: Users will have different options based on their roles within the organization.
- **Background Operation**: The application should run in the background, displaying pop-ups based on user roles.
- **Unique User Identification**: The application must obtain the computer's [MAC address](#mac-address) to ensure the person activating the hardware is the same person validating through the application.

```mermaid
graph
    subgraph Application Interaction
    app{Application}
    apipro{API} --Notification--> app
    app --Ask--> user
    user[/User/] --Confirm--> appreq[/Application/]
    appreq --Mac Address--> api
    end
```

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
<!-- List the non-functional requirements, such as performance, security, and usability. -->
