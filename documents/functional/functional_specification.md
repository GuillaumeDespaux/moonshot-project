## Introduction
Some years ago when I where trainer with my parents, doing roll call was a simple and strait forward task. We had approximately 10 trainees per session, so there where no difficulty at all for this task. However when I stopped being a trainer and became myself a trainee again to change job to be in the IT, I saw that doing this task depending the size of the organization isn't the same. For example I arrived in 2023 at ALGOSUP school and sawing Jean-Philipe losing around 20-30 minutes each morning and afternoon doing the roll call for all students make me realize: "Why don't we automate this task?".

## Objectives
This is why today I present this project as moon shot. The main goal is to prevent losing more time doing this long and fastidious task for companies who don't want to lose energy and time, also I want to create something easy to use, compatible with a lot of devices, and also make it the less expensive as possible.

## Scope
Define the scope of the project, including what is in scope and what is out of scope.

## Functional Requirements
Detail the functional requirements of the project. Each requirement should be clearly stated and numbered.

## Non-Functional Requirements
List the non-functional requirements, such as performance, security, and usability.

## Use Cases
Describe the use cases for the project. Each use case should include a description, actors involved, preconditions, postconditions, and the main flow of events.

## Assumptions and Constraints
List any assumptions and constraints that apply to the project.

## Glossary
Provide definitions for any terms or acronyms used in the document.

## Appendices
Include any additional information or documents that support the functional specification.
